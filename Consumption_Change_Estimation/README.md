1. `Data_Collection` includes some code for the data collection process. For the electricity data, some manual steps were required in processing the raw data, so the code is not complete. Please contact the authors with questions about the pre-processing of the raw data and to obtain the pre-processed electricity data. See Table S1 in the paper for links to download the raw data.
2. `model_fitting.py` should be run for every country/region.
3. `load_covid_data.py` contains functions used in `model_fitting.py`
4. `Monthly_Countries` runs estimates for the 5 countries with only monthly data. These results are not used in the main analysis in the paper but are presented in Figure 2 (the map).
