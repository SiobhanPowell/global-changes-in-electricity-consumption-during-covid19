Buechler, Elizabeth, Siobhan Powell, Tao Sun, Chad Zanocco, Nicolas Astier, Jose Bolorinos, June Flora, Hilary Boudet, and Ram Rajagopal. "Global Changes in Electricity Consumption During COVID-19." Submitted (2021).

This paper studies the change in electricity consumption in 58 countries/regions around the world during the 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from January to October of 2020. The modeling framework used to estimate these changes is implemented in `Consumption_Change_Estimation/model_fitting.py`; other researchers can use this code to apply the framework, to analyze either other countries in 2020 or other consumption shocks in the future.

### Contact
The lead technical contact for the paper is Professor Ram Rajagopal: ramr 'at' stanford 'dot' edu. 

### Data
The main data set generated by our analysis is posted publicly here: [link]. We cannot host the raw data used as inputs, but it is available upon request. As it is all publicly available, we have provided links to the sources to collect it (see Table S1 in paper). 

### Folder structure 
1. Data (see README in Data folder)
2. Consumption_Change_Estimation contains the code to process raw consumption data and estimate the percent change 
3. Analysis contains the code for the panel regression, clustering, and other analyses included in the paper and supplement
4. Figures, where the code will place figures generated by the analyses
